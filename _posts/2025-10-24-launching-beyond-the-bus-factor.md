excerpt: "Introducing practical resources for building resilient projects that survive beyond any individual contributor"

Most open source projects are one key person away from crisis. Today we're launching Beyond the Bus Factor to change that.

## What we're building

Free, community-driven resources for:

- Identifying vulnerabilities before they become emergencies
- Planning for inevitable transitions
- Building sustainable governance
- Practising crisis response

## Why I started this project

I'm preparing for a three-month off-grid sabbatical next year. Facing that reality forced me to confront every single point of failure in the Mautic project.

These resources emerged from that preparation - and from conversations with dozens of maintainers facing the same challenges.

## Get involved

Building projects that outlast us starts with confronting uncomfortable realities. Let's do that together.
